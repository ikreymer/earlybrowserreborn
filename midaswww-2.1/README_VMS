                                                            Obtaining Midas WWW
                              OBTAINING MIDAS WWW
                                       
   There are two ways to go about obtaining Midas WWW: 
   
      Fetch one of the pre-compiled binaries 
      
      Build it yourself from the source code 
      
   We recommend you initially try the pre-compiled binaries, and only resort 
   to building your own version if: 
   
      The pre-compiled binary does not exist for your machine, or will not run 
      
      You are curious to see how it works 
      
      You want to change something 
      
   If you have already obtained Midas WWW but are having problems,  try the
   troubleshooting guide. 
                                        Midas WWW pre-compiled binaries for VMS
                    MIDAS WWW PRE-COMPILED BINARIES FOR VMS
                                       
   Currently pre-compiled binaries for VMS are only available for use with
   MULTINET TCP/IP software. We hope to make UCX binaries available some time
   in the future. The binary files are available as a compressed backup file,
   containing both VAX and ALPHA images, and a few auxilliary files needed to
   run the image. 
   
   To run the pre-compiled binaries you need to have MULTINET software and
   DecWindows Motif installed. 
   
Obtaining and running the VMS binaries

   The binaries are available using FTP from freehep.scri.fsu.eduin directory  
   freehep/networking_email_news/midaswww/binaries/vms.
   
   The following files are available: 
   
  midaswww_multinet.bck_Z 
                         Compiled under VMS 5.5 and OPEN-VMS 1.5 with Multinet 
                         
   To uncompress the file you must use the LZDCMP program (available in the
   same directory, as  lzdcmp.exe). 
   
   To obtain and run the pre-compiled binary files follow these instructions: 
   

   ftp freehep.scri.fsu.edu
      login as user anonymous
   cd freehep/networking_email_news/midaswww/binaries/vms
   binary
   get midaswww_multinet.bck_Z
   get lzdcmp.exe        
   quit

   lzdcmp :== "sys$disk:[]lzdcmp"  
   lzdcmp midaswww_multinet.bck_Z midaswww.bck
   backup/log midaswww.bck/save [] 

   The following files should now be created: 
   
  midaswww_alpha.exe     The ALPHA executable 
                         
  midaswww_vax.exe       The VAX executable 
                         
  midas.uid,midaswww.uid These are Motif User Interface Definition files. They
                         are required in order to run the executable. 
                         
  midaswww.vue$dat,vue$midaswww.com
                         Files that simplify running Midas WWW from a Fileview
                         or Session Manager menu. 
                         
  install.com            A simple .com file for installing the above  files in
                         system directories. 
                         
   To try out Midas WWW just type 
   

   run midaswww_vax         or
   run midaswww_alpha

   as appropriate. The MidasWWW window should now appear.  If it doesn't then
   see thetroubleshooting guide. 
   
Installing Midas WWW

   To install MidasWWW in the appropriate system directories, issue the
   command: 
   

   @install

   You will be asked which directory you wish to install the .exe file in, 
   just hit return if you are happy to install in the default SYS$SYSTEM 
   directory. 
   
   When the .com file finished it will ask you to add a line to your
   SYLOGIN.COM file to make a symbol available to users. Once this has been
   done then Midas WWW can be invoked by issuing the command: 
   

   midaswww

   or by selecting the World Wide Web entry from the Applicationsmenu in the
   Session Manager.   
                                         MidasWWW VAX Installation Instructions
                         VAX INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
                                       
   These instructions are for the VAX. See  README file for UNIX installation
   instructions. 
   
Requirements

   To install this version of MidasWWW you will need a VAX running VMS 5.4 or
   greater, with DecWindows/Motif  and C installed.  
   
   Currently  MidasWWW has only been run with  Multinet TCP/IP software.  It
   should be possible to run it with other versions of TCP/IP for the VAX
   without too much trouble,  if you succeed please feed the changes back to 
   us. 
   
Obtaining MidasWWW

   You can obtain MidasWWW as a compressed backup file via anonymous FTP from 
   FreeHEP.Scri.Fsu.Edu, in directory   /freehep/networking_email_news/midaswww
   
   NoteYou should use the compress BACKUP file for VMS installation, not the
   TAR file, as the BACKUP file contains some extra VMS only files. You will
   need to use the lzdcmputility to decompress the backup file, this is also
   available as an exe file from FreeHEP.Scri.Fsu.Edu in the directory 
   /freehep/networking_email_news/midaswww/binaries/vms. 
   
   You can fetch, decompress and unpack the MidasWWW backup file as follows: 
   

  ftp freehep.scri.fsu.edu
     login as user anonymous
  cd /freehep/networking_email_news/midaswww
  binary
  get midaswww-2.1.bck_Z midaswww.bck_Z
  get binaries/vms/lzdcmp.exe
  quit
  lzdmp :== "$sys$disk:lzdcmp"
  lzdcmp midaswww.bck_Z midaswww.bck
  backup/log midaswww.bck/save []

Building

   Once you have uncompressed and unpacked the file, you can build the
   executable by issuing the command: 
   

   @make

   The .COM file will build MidasWWW on either a VAX or an ALPHA. Note that at
   present it has only been tested using Multinet software.  
   
Testing

   To try out MidasWWW first make sure your X windows DISPLAY is set up
   correctly (use the  SET DISPLAY command to set it). Then issue the command: 
   

   run midaswww

   The MidasWWW window should now appear.  If it doesn't then see
   thetroubleshooting guide. 
   
Installing

   To install MidasWWW in the appropriate system directories, issue the
   command: 
   

   @install

   You will be asked which directory you wish to install the .exe file in, 
   just hit return if you are happy to install in the default SYS$SYSTEM 
   directory. 
   
   When the .com file finished it will ask you to add a line to your
   SYLOGIN.COM file to make a symbol available to users. Once this has been
   done then Midas WWW can be invoked by issuing the command: 
   

   midaswww

   or by selecting the World Wide Web entry from the Applicationsmenu in the
   Session Manager.
